# CharCollection

With this module you can easily generate a sequence from 1 to 75 characters, including special characters ``(!@#$%^&*()_=+[]{};:"\|,).``
This is a stand-alone module, from dependencies , only built-in random module (for now).

There is also a class for **generating a password** from characters from 6 to 20, including special characters.
